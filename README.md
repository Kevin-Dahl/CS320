To ensure my code is functional and secure each facet of it should be tested. By testing each error that should be given off, each way that someone can try to access or use the code, and by ensuring that everything that should not give an error passes without issue, we can get code that works much better than one that is simply put together and believed to be working. Ensuring your product meets the needs of a client and works about all facets of the desires securely means that the client will be pleased, your work will be well recieved, and if they client needs something done again they will likely come to you for future dealings.
Interpreting the needs of a client is straightforward as asking them what they want the code to do. Take what your client wants and run through what that entails and come to an agreement that that is what they want made. By running through this with the client you can get much cleaner nicer code that does not need to run through last minute changes because of a misunderstanding.
My approach to designing software is one where I double check what I am making, break it down into parts, and start from the ground up by making the peices then adding the go between for them. By doing this it means that I can work piecemal in my code before putting them all together. It is like prepping the ingredients before cooking. You prepare them then put them all together for a delicious meal.
